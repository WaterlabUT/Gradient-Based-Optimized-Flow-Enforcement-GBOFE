Download the code: Locate the GBOFE folder and download the source code to your computer.

Run the script: Open the main file in your preferred Python IDE and run it.

Choose the flow-enforcement method: In the interface, select the technique you wish to apply:

Normal Excavation

Normal Excavation Modified

r.carve

Gradient-Based Optimized Flow Enforcement (GBOFE)

Specify the input DEM: Enter the full path to the Digital Elevation Model (including file name and extension), e.g. FABDEM.tif.

Specify the drainage network: Enter the full path to the drainage vector file (including file name and extension), e.g. Drainage.shp.

Set the carving depth (if applicable):

For Normal Excavation, Normal Excavation Modified, or r.carve, specify the carving depth in metres to be applied along the drainage network.

Set the gradient (GBOFE only):

If you select GBOFE, define the slope-reduction gradient 
ùê∫
>
0
G>0. A recommended default is 
ùê∫
=
0.001
G=0.001.

Configure the output: Provide the path and file name for the corrected DEM, e.g. FABDEM_burn.tif.

Note: Ensure the drainage network is digitized from upstream (source) to downstream (outlet).
